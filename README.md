## A Simple Pipeline for Real Time Data Monitoring System
---------------------------
### Real-time Time-Series Data Monitoring System using RabbitMQ , InfluxDB and Chronograf
---------------------------------------------------------


Now-a-days it has become very important to monitor the data from various sources (Network data, sensor data etc..) to take smart decisions based on the results. Often it becomes a hectic to make a proper pipeline where data will autoatically flow from source to final Database, without losing it.

To resolve this problem, this repository has been built that provides a solution for end-to-end data flow pipeline via **RabbitMQ** and **InfluxDB**. 

**RabbitMQ** is a *Message Queuing Technique* that enables decoupling, and also enhances the performance.The data is not lost anywhere in between. **InfluxDB** is a very popular DB that provides great solution or **time-series data** and the data can be Visualised via **Chronograf** in Real-Time.

**P.S.**, Here the example data is **Server Data** which contains all the values like, bytes_in , bytes_out etc. But this repository can be used for other data sources, with little modification, with are self explanatory from the code.

### Directory Architecture
--------------------
[See here](https://github.com/Niloy-Chakraborty/Real-Time-Data-Monitoring-System/blob/master/Directory%20Architecture.txt)

### Guidelines:
---------------------
After installing all the softwares (mentioned below) and packages (from requirements.txt), you need to do the following:
1) Unzip the data (If you need to do so..)
2) Run *[main](https://github.com/Niloy-Chakraborty/Real-Time-Data-Monitoring-System/blob/master/main.py)* file. It will create Json data and publish it to the Message Queue
3) Run *[consumer](https://github.com/Niloy-Chakraborty/Real-Time-Data-Monitoring-System/blob/master/Consumer.py)*. It will consume the data from MQ and insert the data to the InfluDB
4) Finally you can easily monitor the data in *Chronograf*.


### SoftWare Installation Guidelines:
------------------------------------

#### A. Erlang- RabbitMQ Installation: 
-------------------------------


1) Go to [here](https://www.erlang.org/downloads) and download the erlang executable.

2) Then Run and install the executable file.

3) Go to [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) and download the rabbitmq executable file.

4) Now Run and Install the RabbitMQ executable

5) In the Command Prompt, Go to the RabbitMQ Server Location and use the command :
   `rabbitmq-server start`

6) Install the RabbitMQ Management Console
   `rabbitmq-plugins.bat enable rabbitmq_management`

7) Next go to `localhost:15672`. The RabbitMQ console will be seen.

#### B. InFluxDB and Chronograf Installation:
-------------------------

1) Go to [here](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/) and download InfluxDB

2) The InfluxDB Version is : *1.7.9*

3) Unzip the downloaded file and run influxd.exe and influx.exe respectively

4) Go to [here](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/) and download Chronograf.

5) The used Chronograf version is *1.7.14*

6) Unfer Unzipping the file, run *chronograf.exe*

7) Open chronograf in `localhost:8888` and configure to see the dashboard.
